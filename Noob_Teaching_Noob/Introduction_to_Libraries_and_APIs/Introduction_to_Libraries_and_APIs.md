### Working with Libraries

#### What are Libraries?
- **Libraries**: Collections of pre-written code that can be reused in various programs.

#### Installing Libraries using pip
- **pip**: A package installer for Python.
- **Installation Command**: `pip install <library_name>`

#### Common Libraries in Python
- **NumPy**: Numeric computations.
- **Pandas**: Data analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.

#### Hands-on Exercise: Data Analysis with Pandas
- **Import a CSV File**: Use Pandas to analyze data.

**Example Code:**
```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(data.describe())

Introduction to APIs
What are APIs?
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): Protocols that allow different software to communicate.
Introduction to RESTful APIs
RESTful APIs: Web services that use HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations.
Hands-on Exercise: Weather App with Open-Meteo API
Fetch Weather Data: Create a weather app using Open-Meteo API.
Example Code:

python
Copy code
import requests

latitude = input("Enter the latitude: ")
longitude = input("Enter the longitude: ")

url = f"https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude={latitude}&longitude={longitude}&current_weather=true&hourly=temperature_2m,relativehumidity_2m,windspeed_10m"

response = requests.get(url)
weather_data = response.json()

current_temperature = weather_data['current_weather']['temperature']
current_windspeed = weather_data['current_weather']['windspeed']

print(f"The current temperature is {current_temperature}Â°C")
print(f"The current wind speed is {current_windspeed} m/s")
Conclusion and Transition
This module provides foundational knowledge in using libraries and APIs, vital skills for efficiency and connectivity in programming. The hands-on exercises offer practical experience, particularly beneficial in data analysis, automation, and chatbot development.
