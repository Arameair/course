**Example Code:**
```python
import requests

API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/gpt2"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}

def query(payload):
    response = requests.post(API_URL, json=payload, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

prompt = input("Enter a prompt: ")
payload = {"inputs": prompt, "max_length": 100}
response = query(payload)

generated_text = response[0]['generated_text']
print(f"Generated Text: {generated_text}")
